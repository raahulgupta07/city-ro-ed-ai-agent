VERIFY_PROMPT = """You are a verification agent. I extracted data from a customs document using AI.
Now I need you to VERIFY each value by looking at the ORIGINAL page images.

## EXTRACTED RESULTS TO VERIFY:
{results_json}

## YOUR TASK:
Look at the page images below. For EACH field in the extracted results:
1. Find the value on the actual page image
2. Check if the extracted value matches what's printed
3. If WRONG or NOT FOUND on any page, correct it

Return ONLY valid JSON with the CORRECTED results:
{{
  "declaration": {{
    <same 16 fields — corrected values where needed>
  }},
  "items": [
    <same items — corrected values where needed>
  ],
  "corrections": [
    {{"field": "<field name>", "original": "<what was extracted>", "corrected": "<what it should be>", "reason": "<why>"}}
  ]
}}

RULES:
- ONLY change values that are clearly WRONG when compared to the page images.
- If a value matches what's printed, keep it exactly as-is.
- Numbers must match EXACTLY (72,802 not 72,803).
- If you find a value that was null but IS visible on a page, fill it in.
- Do NOT hallucinate — if you can't find a value on any page, leave it as null.
- "Exchange Rate (1)" on items is always the same as declaration Exchange Rate — do NOT change it.
- CRITICAL for fee fields (CT, AT, SF, MF): Each fee must match its SPECIFIC labeled row in the tax/fee table. Do NOT shift values between fee fields. "Commercial Tax" goes to CT, "Security Fee" goes to SF, "MACCS" goes to MF. If a fee is 0, keep it 0.
- Only CORRECT a value if the page image shows a DIFFERENT number. Do NOT remove values just because you can't find them on a specific page — they may come from a different page.
- Return ONLY valid JSON.
